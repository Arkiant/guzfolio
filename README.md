# Guzfolio

Guzfolio is a cryptocurrency portfolio tracker with the purpose of using it as a pattern for the implementation of good 
practices in the development of API's in [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) using [Go](https://golang.org). 
As main dependency we will use [gqlgen](https://gqlgen.com) to generate our API, probably the best option.

We will initially follow the example [gqlgen-pg-todo-example](https://github.com/oshalygin/gqlgen-pg-todo-example) 
developed by [oshalygin](https://github.com/oshalygin) (thanks for your work!) to later add new more complex 
functionality like as authorization, nested elements in the data model, unit test, etc...  

# TODO
* Define project scope
* Create data model
* Create GraphQL schema
